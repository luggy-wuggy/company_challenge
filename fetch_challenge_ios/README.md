I must admit, it's been awhile since I've coded in Swift so I was a bit rusty on syntax structure and architecture. But once I got my groove and looked at some documentation, it was like riding a bike, a bit wobbly but stable. XCode(Swift) was actually my first mobile framwork I learned, but as of lately I have gotten into the Flutter framework and let me tell you..... it's magical. I can tell you more about it! It's truly amazing, and deserves it's recognization.


However, working on this iOS exercise made me realize that I cannot progress as a developer if I am in a comfortable state. I became pigeonholed into Flutter and got too comfortable at it, to the point where I lost basis with my iOS dev. So, honest to god, thank you for clarifying to write in native code. It's inspired me to continue on learning/growth in iOS dev. Native code will never go away haha. However, this does not at all disdain my love for Flutter. I truly truly believe Flutter will be such an important framework in the future, and will be used in many ways (mobile app, web app, web) and all sorts of companies(start-up, mid-size, Big Five).

Here are some articles of Flutter used by esteemed companies:
