This is a Flutter project, meaning it can run on both iOS or android. This also means that you need to have Flutter/Dart installed on your computer in order to run the app. 

The packages I used is the http and provider libraries.
The http is simply to GET the json data from the link.
The provider is a state management pattern used to make UI renders more efficient and to have accessible data for different states. 
Everything else is pure Flutter/Dart.


If you want to look at the codebase, it is under the lib folder.

## Getting Started
* Start by installing Flutter/Dart and a compatible IDE (I recommend VSCode).
* Clone the following project into your system and open it through a Flutter compatible IDE.
* Upon opening, there will be a ton of errors for missing packages/libraries. But don't worry.
* Run "flutter packages get" into the the terminal inside the project and let the IDE do it's job.
* Eventually the errors will resolve itself.
* Open a mobile simulator, iOS or android
      (My method is by running "flutter emulators --launch ios" [for mac only] in the terminal).
* Once your IDE detects a mobile simulator (if you are using VSCode, there's a label on the bottom right corner), you can launch the application (if you are using VSCode, you can either launch it through Debugging mode or running "flutter run" in terminal).
